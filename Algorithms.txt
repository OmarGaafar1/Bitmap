### ALGORITHMS FOR THE FILTERS

## Filter 1: Black and White Image
check every pixel if it is greater than 127(grey) then make it 255(white)
if smaller than 127 make it black(0)



## Filter 2: Invert Image
change every pixel to equal = 255 - pixelvalue
if pixel value was white then the output is black
//	       was black then the output is white
//	       was grey then the output is grey 
etc.



## Filter 3: Merge Images




## Filter 4: Flip Image
interchange the first pixel with the last pixel till they reach
the middle row in the middle column




## Filter 5: Rotate Image




## Filter 6: Darken and Lighten Image
in the darkening case, remove half of the value of the pixel with value = value - 0.5* value.
i.e. value = 200 -> value = 100

in the lightening case, add half of the value of the pixel with value = value + 0.5*(value + 1).
i.e.  value = 10 -> 15




## Filter 7: Detect Image Edges
uses the black and white filter then then if the next two colors are of the same color i.e pix1-pix2 = 0
pix1 becomes black. does the same vertically for the pixels.
else the pixel becomes white.



## Filter 8: Enlarge Image



## Filter 9: Shrink Image



## Filter a: Mirror Image
for 1/2 right: change the value of the (1st pixel) with the value of the (1st last pixel of the same row)
(2nd) pixel with (2nd last) pixel and so on, till we reach the middle column for each row.

for 1/2 left: change the value of the (1st last pixel) with the value of the (1st pixel of the same row)
(2nd last) pixel with the (2nd) pixel and so on, till we reach the middle column for each row.

for 1/2 up: change the value of the (1st last pixel) with the value of the (1st pixel of the same column)
(2nd last) pixel with the (2nd) pixel and so on, till we reach the middle row for each column.

for 1/2 down: change the value of the (1st pixel) with the value of the (1st last pixel of the same column)
(2nd) pixel with the (2nd last) pixel and so on, till we reach the middle row for each column.




## Filter b: Shuffle Image




## Filter c: Blur Image
